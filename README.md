# albumanalysis
Album sentiment analysis using Genius.com API and lyricsgenius library.

You can input any artist or album of your liking, the notebook will scrapte Genius.com and confirm the album you are looking for, then it will download the lyrics, perform sentiment analysis, and give you some nice graphs and a wordcloud.

I am adding to this project, would like to visualize an artists entire discography or artist x vs artist y.

Requires a Genius.com API key -- https://genius.com/api-clients
